      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>We are a group of passionate avionics students from the University of Saad Dahleb Blida 1, Institute of Aeronautics and Space Studies. Currently in our third year of avionics, we are deeply fascinated by electronics, with a particular focus on the electronics of airplanes. This shared passion has led us to create this website, AeroNova_X, where we showcase all the projects and innovations we've developed as a team, as well as the exciting ideas and projects from our fellow students. AeroNova_X is not just a platform for our current work, but a space where future aerospace innovations will come to life.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="secondary-section" id="project-name">
      <h2>The Name</h2>
      <p>The name "AeroNova_X" embodies the spirit of innovation, precision, and the limitless possibilities in the world of aeronautics. "Aero" is derived from the Greek word for air, symbolizing the team’s deep connection to the principles of flight and aerospace engineering. "Nova" reflects the concept of a new, bright star—representing the team's ambition to shine brightly in the realm of RC aviation and engineering. The "X" at the end adds an element of mystery and potential, hinting at the unknown frontiers the team is eager to explore, from advanced design innovations to cutting-edge technologies in the RC aviation world. AeroNova_X isn’t just a name—it’s a vision, a mission to push boundaries and redefine what’s possible in the skies, inspiring both current and future generations to reach for new heights.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="secondary-section" id="the-idea">
      <h2>The Idea</h2>
      <p>Our idea began with a simple thought: as a team, we wanted to share our work and the work of future students with the broader community. Why not make it available to other students and even professional recruiters? By showcasing our projects on AeroNova_X, we offer a platform where others can highlight their achievements, adding them to their CVs for future opportunities. However, we must not forget the true driving force behind this project: Teacher Choutri, who teaches the "TP Instrument de Bord" module. He graciously provided us with the opportunity to demonstrate our potential and showcase what we are capable of. Thanks to his support, we are here today, bringing this vision to life.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="secondary-section" id="sponsor">
      <h2>Our Sponsors</h2>
      <p>We would like to express our deepest gratitude to our sponsor, the University of Saad Dahleb Blida 1, for their continuous support and for providing the foundation that allowed us to embark on this journey. We are also incredibly thankful to Teacher Choutri, whose generosity and guidance have been instrumental in making our project possible. He provided us with the materials, funding, and all the necessary resources we needed. More importantly, he encouraged us to think outside the box, explore new ideas, and continuously search for innovative solutions. His belief in our potential has been a driving force, and we are truly grateful for his support.</p>

      <h2>Presentation of the Project</h2>
      <p>Explore the design and features of the AeroNovaX RC plane. The <strong>AeroNova_X_1</strong> is the first RC plane developed by our team as part of the AeroNova_X project. We chose to integrate advanced avionics and control systems, using the <strong>Pixhawk 2.4.8</strong> as the central microcontroller for flight management. The Pixhawk is a high-performance flight controller capable of stabilizing the plane, handling navigation via GPS, and enabling autonomous flight with precision. The airplane is powered by a <strong>Brushless Motor 2212</strong> with an 8×6 propeller and utilizes a <strong>LiPo battery</strong> for efficient power management. With a wingspan of 810 mm and a total weight of 560 g (with electronics), this plane was designed for performance, efficiency, and easy handling. Through detailed aerodynamic calculations, we’ve ensured that the plane can achieve the necessary lift and thrust to perform as required.</p>

    <div class="secondary-section" id="materials">
      <h2>Materials Used</h2>
      <p>For the construction of the AeroNova_X_1, we used a combination of materials to achieve the right balance of strength and weight:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Maquette Paper</strong>: We began by creating models and prototypes with maquette paper to outline the initial design and shape of the plane. This step helped visualize the aerodynamic properties and fit of the components.</li>
        <li><strong>Foam</strong>: Lightweight and durable foam was used to construct the main body, wings, and stabilizers. This material ensures that the plane remains light without sacrificing structural integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>Hot Glue Gun</strong>: To assemble the various parts, we used a hot glue gun, which allowed us to securely bond the foam pieces and other components together.</li>
        <li><strong>Ruler and Cutter</strong>: Precision tools such as rulers and cutters were essential for measuring and cutting the foam and paper accurately.</li>
        <li><strong>Servos (Micro 9g)</strong>: For controlling the ailerons, elevator, and rudder, we used four micro servos. These small but powerful servos are essential for precise control of the flight surfaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Pixhawk Flight Controller</strong>: The Pixhawk 2.4.8 was chosen for its robust performance in controlling all flight functions, including stabilization, navigation, and communication with ground control.</li>
        <li><strong>Battery (LiPo 2200 mAh)</strong>: We used a 2200 mAh LiPo battery to power the plane, balancing flight time with weight. The battery’s capacity allows for around 10 minutes of flight.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additional tools and materials such as glue sticks, soldering equipment, wires, connectors, and carbon fiber rods were used in the assembly to reinforce certain parts of the plane and improve overall durability.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="secondary-section" id="work-processing">
      <h2>Work Processing</h2>
      <p>Our work on the AeroNova_X_1 followed a systematic project management process, ensuring that each stage was well-planned and executed.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Study and Aerodynamic Design</strong>: The first step was to perform a detailed study of the plane’s aerodynamics. We used the specifications from our previous RC plane project and applied them to AeroNova_X_1, making necessary adjustments for the new design. This step involved considering factors like the lift-to-weight ratio, wing shape, and the stall speed.</li>
        <li><strong>Simulation and Validation</strong>: Once we had a design ready, we used <strong>XFLR5</strong>, a powerful aerodynamic simulation tool, to simulate the flight performance of the plane. This simulation helped us fine-tune the design, ensuring that the aircraft would fly stably and achieve the required performance parameters.</li>
        <li><strong>Realization and Assembly</strong>: With the design validated, we moved on to the realization phase. This involved gathering all the materials, cutting and assembling the parts, and installing the components like the servos, Pixhawk, motor, and battery. This step required careful attention to detail to ensure that the weight distribution was optimal and that everything was securely mounted.</li>
        <li><strong>First Flight Preparation</strong>: After successfully assembling the plane, we moved on to preparing for the first flight. This phase includes final checks on the flight controller, calibration of sensors, and verifying all control surfaces. Although the plane is ready for its first test flight, we are still refining certain aspects to ensure optimal performance.</li>
